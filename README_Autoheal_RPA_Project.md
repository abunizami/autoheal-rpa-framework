# Automated Remediation Framework using RPA and Autoheal

## üìå Project Overview
This project outlines the implementation of an automated remediation framework using Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and Autoheal mechanisms. The goal is to reduce manual intervention in infrastructure incident management by integrating monitoring tools, ITSM platforms, and automation bots.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
The solution integrates:
- **Monitoring Tools**: Azure Monitor, Prometheus
- **ITSM**: ServiceNow for incident management
- **Automation**: RPA bots for remediation tasks
- **Orchestration**: Secure and scalable deployment of bots

## üîÑ Workflow
1. Monitoring tools detect anomalies or failures.
2. Alerts are forwarded to ServiceNow to create incidents.
3. RPA bots are triggered to perform predefined remediation actions.
4. If remediation fails, the incident is escalated to the support team.

## ‚úÖ Deployment Checklist
Autoheal Solution Deployment Checklist and Interface Specification
Deployment Checklist
Environment Setup
‚òê Provision RPA Orchestrator (e.g., UiPath, Automation Anywhere)
‚òê Ensure network connectivity between RPA bots and target servers (Windows/Linux)
‚òê Install and configure ServiceNow MID Server (if required)
‚òê Ensure Azure Monitor and/or Prometheus agents are installed on all servers
Integration Configuration
‚òê Configure Azure Monitor alerts and Action Groups
‚òê Set up webhook/API integration from Azure Monitor to ServiceNow
‚òê Create ServiceNow incident rules for autoheal triggers
‚òê Configure RPA Orchestrator to poll or receive triggers from ServiceNow
Security and Access Control
‚òê Create service accounts for RPA bots with least privilege access
‚òê Configure WinRM (Windows) and SSH (Linux) access for bots
‚òê Secure API credentials and tokens using vault or credential manager
‚òê Enable audit logging on all components
Testing and Validation
‚òê Simulate alerts from Azure Monitor and verify ticket creation in ServiceNow
‚òê Test RPA bot remediation workflows on test servers
‚òê Validate ticket updates and resolution status in ServiceNow
‚òê Perform end-to-end test with escalation scenario
Escalation Handling
‚òê Define escalation rules in ServiceNow for unresolved incidents
‚òê Configure RPA bots to update ticket status and assign to support engineer
‚òê Verify notification and SLA compliance for escalated tickets
Interface Specification Document
Azure Monitor to ServiceNow
Protocol: HTTPS (Webhook)
Direction: Outbound from Azure Monitor
Authentication: OAuth2 or Shared Secret
Data Format: JSON
Payload Example: {"alertName": "HighCPU", "resource": "Server01", "severity": "Critical"}
ServiceNow to RPA Orchestrator
Protocol: REST API or Queue Trigger
Direction: Outbound from ServiceNow
Authentication: API Key or OAuth2
Data Format: JSON
Payload Example: {"incidentId": "INC0012345", "category": "CPU", "server": "Server01"}
RPA Bot to Target Server
Protocol: WinRM (Windows) / SSH (Linux)
Direction: Bidirectional
Authentication: Kerberos / SSH Key / Password
Data Format: Command Execution
Payload Example: Restart-Service -Name "Spooler" (Windows), systemctl restart apache2 (Linux)
RPA Bot to ServiceNow
Protocol: REST API
Direction: Outbound from RPA Bot
Authentication: OAuth2 or API Token
Data Format: JSON
Payload Example: {"incidentId": "INC0012345", "status": "Resolved", "notes": "Service restarted successfully."}

## üîå Interface Specifications
- **Input**: Alerts from Azure Monitor or Prometheus
- **Processing**: Incident creation in ServiceNow, bot invocation
- **Output**: Remediation logs, incident resolution or escalation

## üìö Key Learnings
Implementation of an Autoheal solution leveraging RPA bots, ServiceNow, and Azure Monitor to remediate routine issues on Windows and Linux servers.
üß≠ Business Requirement Summary
The organization requires an automated remediation framework that:
Detects and resolves routine infrastructure issues on Windows and Linux servers.
Integrates with ServiceNow for incident management and escalation.
Leverages Azure Monitor for real-time telemetry and alerting.
Engages support engineers when automated remediation fails.
üîç Gap Analysis
üß© Solution Design Overview
üîó Integration Points
Azure Monitor / Prometheus: Detects anomalies and triggers alerts.
ServiceNow: Receives alerts via webhook/API and creates incident tickets.
RPA Orchestrator (UiPath / Automation Anywhere):
Polls or receives triggers from ServiceNow.
Executes remediation workflows on target servers.
Updates ServiceNow tickets with diagnostics and resolution details.
üîÑ Autoheal Workflow
Issue Detection: Azure Monitor detects a server issue (e.g., high CPU, service down).
Alert Routing: Alert sent to ServiceNow via webhook or Azure Action Group.
Incident Creation: ServiceNow logs the incident and categorizes it.
Bot Trigger: RPA Orchestrator triggers bot based on incident type.
Remediation Execution:
Windows: Restart services, clear temp files, kill hung processes.
Linux: Restart daemons, rotate logs, free disk space.
Ticket Update: Bot posts diagnostics, actions taken, and resolution status.
Escalation Logic: If issue persists, ticket is escalated to support engineer.
üñ•Ô∏è Physical Network Blueprint
Monitoring Layer: Azure Monitor, Prometheus agents on servers.
Integration Layer: Azure Event Grid / Logic Apps ‚Üí ServiceNow API.
Automation Layer: RPA Orchestrator hosted in secure subnet.
Execution Layer: RPA bots with access to Windows/Linux servers via WinRM/SSH.
ServiceNow MID Server (optional): For secure internal communication.
üîå Interface Definitions
üöÄ Deployment Blueprint
Environment: Hybrid cloud (Azure + on-prem)
Security: Role-based access, encrypted credentials, audit logging
Scalability: Horizontal scaling of bots based on ticket volume
Monitoring: Bot health, execution logs, ticket resolution metrics
