# Autoheal RPA Project Documentation

This project outlines the implementation of an automated remediation framework using RPA bots, Azure Monitor, and ServiceNow integration.

## RPA Implementation for Remediation

Implementation of an Autoheal solution leveraging RPA bots, ServiceNow, and Azure Monitor to remediate routine issues on Windows and Linux servers.

🧭 Business Requirement Summary

The organization requires an automated remediation framework that:

Detects and resolves routine infrastructure issues on Windows and Linux servers.

Integrates with ServiceNow for incident management and escalation.

Leverages Azure Monitor for real-time telemetry and alerting.

Engages support engineers when automated remediation fails.

🔍 Gap Analysis

🧩 Solution Design Overview

🔗 Integration Points

Azure Monitor / Prometheus: Detects anomalies and triggers alerts.

ServiceNow: Receives alerts via webhook/API and creates incident tickets.

RPA Orchestrator (UiPath / Automation Anywhere):

Polls or receives triggers from ServiceNow.

Executes remediation workflows on target servers.

Updates ServiceNow tickets with diagnostics and resolution details.

🔄 Autoheal Workflow

Issue Detection: Azure Monitor detects a server issue (e.g., high CPU, service down).

Alert Routing: Alert sent to ServiceNow via webhook or Azure Action Group.

Incident Creation: ServiceNow logs the incident and categorizes it.

Bot Trigger: RPA Orchestrator triggers bot based on incident type.

Remediation Execution:

Windows: Restart services, clear temp files, kill hung processes.

Linux: Restart daemons, rotate logs, free disk space.

Ticket Update: Bot posts diagnostics, actions taken, and resolution status.

Escalation Logic: If issue persists, ticket is escalated to support engineer.

🖥️ Physical Network Blueprint

Monitoring Layer: Azure Monitor, Prometheus agents on servers.

Integration Layer: Azure Event Grid / Logic Apps → ServiceNow API.

Automation Layer: RPA Orchestrator hosted in secure subnet.

Execution Layer: RPA bots with access to Windows/Linux servers via WinRM/SSH.

ServiceNow MID Server (optional): For secure internal communication.

🔌 Interface Definitions

🚀 Deployment Blueprint

Environment: Hybrid cloud (Azure + on-prem)

Security: Role-based access, encrypted credentials, audit logging

Scalability: Horizontal scaling of bots based on ticket volume

Monitoring: Bot health, execution logs, ticket resolution metrics

## Autoheal Deployment Checklist and Interface Specification

Autoheal Solution Deployment Checklist and Interface Specification

Deployment Checklist

Environment Setup

- Provision RPA Orchestrator (e.g., UiPath, Automation Anywhere)

- Ensure network connectivity between RPA bots and target servers (Windows/Linux)

- Install and configure ServiceNow MID Server (if required)

- Ensure Azure Monitor and/or Prometheus agents are installed on all servers

Integration Configuration

- Configure Azure Monitor alerts and Action Groups

- Set up webhook/API integration from Azure Monitor to ServiceNow

- Create ServiceNow incident rules for autoheal triggers

- Configure RPA Orchestrator to poll or receive triggers from ServiceNow

Security and Access Control

- Create service accounts for RPA bots with least privilege access

- Configure WinRM (Windows) and SSH (Linux) access for bots

- Secure API credentials and tokens using vault or credential manager

- Enable audit logging on all components

Testing and Validation

- Simulate alerts from Azure Monitor and verify ticket creation in ServiceNow

- Test RPA bot remediation workflows on test servers

- Validate ticket updates and resolution status in ServiceNow

- Perform end-to-end test with escalation scenario

Escalation Handling

- Define escalation rules in ServiceNow for unresolved incidents

- Configure RPA bots to update ticket status and assign to support engineer

- Verify notification and SLA compliance for escalated tickets
