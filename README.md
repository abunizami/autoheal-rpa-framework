# Autoheal RPA Project Documentation

## RPA Implementation for Remediation

Implementation of an Autoheal solution leveraging RPA bots, ServiceNow, and Azure Monitor to remediate routine issues on Windows and Linux servers.

🧭 Business Requirement Summary
The organization requires an automated remediation framework that:
Detects and resolves routine infrastructure issues on Windows and Linux servers.
Integrates with ServiceNow for incident management and escalation.
Leverages Azure Monitor for real-time telemetry and alerting.
Engages support engineers when automated remediation fails.

🔍 Gap Analysis

🧩 Solution Design Overview
🔗 Integration Points
Azure Monitor / Prometheus: Detects anomalies and triggers alerts.
ServiceNow: Receives alerts via webhook/API and creates incident tickets.
RPA Orchestrator (UiPath / Automation Anywhere):
Polls or receives triggers from ServiceNow.
Executes remediation workflows on target servers.
Updates ServiceNow tickets with diagnostics and resolution details.
🔄 Autoheal Workflow
Issue Detection: Azure Monitor detects a server issue (e.g., high CPU, service down).
Alert Routing: Alert sent to ServiceNow via webhook or Azure Action Group.
Incident Creation: ServiceNow logs the incident and categorizes it.
Bot Trigger: RPA Orchestrator triggers bot based on incident type.
Remediation Execution:
Windows: Restart services, clear temp files, kill hung processes.
Linux: Restart daemons, rotate logs, free disk space.
Ticket Update: Bot posts diagnostics, actions taken, and resolution status.
Escalation Logic: If issue persists, ticket is escalated to support engineer.

🖥️ Physical Network Blueprint
Monitoring Layer: Azure Monitor, Prometheus agents on servers.
Integration Layer: Azure Event Grid / Logic Apps → ServiceNow API.
Automation Layer: RPA Orchestrator hosted in secure subnet.
Execution Layer: RPA bots with access to Windows/Linux servers via WinRM/SSH.
ServiceNow MID Server (optional): For secure internal communication.

🔌 Interface Definitions

🚀 Deployment Blueprint
Environment: Hybrid cloud (Azure + on-prem)
Security: Role-based access, encrypted credentials, audit logging
Scalability: Horizontal scaling of bots based on ticket volume
Monitoring: Bot health, execution logs, ticket resolution metrics

## Autoheal Deployment Checklist and Interface Specification

Autoheal Solution Deployment Checklist and Interface Specification
Deployment Checklist
Environment Setup
- ☐ Provision RPA Orchestrator (e.g., UiPath, Automation Anywhere)
- ☐ Ensure network connectivity between RPA bots and target servers (Windows/Linux)
- ☐ Install and configure ServiceNow MID Server (if required)
- ☐ Ensure Azure Monitor and/or Prometheus agents are installed on all servers
Integration Configuration
- ☐ Configure Azure Monitor alerts and Action Groups
- ☐ Set up webhook/API integration from Azure Monitor to ServiceNow
- ☐ Create ServiceNow incident rules for autoheal triggers
- ☐ Configure RPA Orchestrator to poll or receive triggers from ServiceNow
Security and Access Control
- ☐ Create service accounts for RPA bots with least privilege access
- ☐ Configure WinRM (Windows) and SSH (Linux) access for bots
- ☐ Secure API credentials and tokens using vault or credential manager
- ☐ Enable audit logging on all components
Testing and Validation
- ☐ Simulate alerts from Azure Monitor and verify ticket creation in ServiceNow
- ☐ Test RPA bot remediation workflows on test servers
- ☐ Validate ticket updates and resolution status in ServiceNow
- ☐ Perform end-to-end test with escalation scenario
Escalation Handling
- ☐ Define escalation rules in ServiceNow for unresolved incidents
- ☐ Configure RPA bots to update ticket status and assign to support engineer
- ☐ Verify notification and SLA compliance for escalated tickets
